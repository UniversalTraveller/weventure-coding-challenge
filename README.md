# Demo of a Todo-App using React and Redux

This is how the app works:

- a new to-do can be added by pressing the enter key
- an item can be marked as done by clicking on it
- an item can be deleted by clicking the "X" button
- the list can be cleared entirely with the button below

That's all. Note that this app doesn't let you save anything.

## Setup

- Clone the repository. In your terminal, enter:

```sh
> $ git clone git@github.com:UniversalTraveller/weventure-coding-challenge.git
```

- Change to the app directory:

```sh

```

- Install dependencies

```sh
> $ npm install
```

```sh

```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
