# Demo of a To-do-App using React and Redux

This is how the app works:

- A new to-do can be added by pressing the enter key in the input field.
- An item can be marked as done by clicking on it.
- An item can be deleted by clicking the "X" button.
- The list can be cleared entirely with the button below.

That's all. Note that this app doesn't let you save anything.

```sh
